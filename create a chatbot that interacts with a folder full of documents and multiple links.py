To create a chatbot that interacts with a folder full of documents and multiple links in Windows 10, you can use Python along with libraries for natural language processing, file handling, and web scraping. Below is a basic outline to get you started:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Install the necessary libraries using pip.

   ```bash
   pip install openai  # for GPT interaction
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests  # for web scraping
   ```

2. **Set Up OpenAI API:**
   Follow the steps mentioned earlier to obtain an API key from OpenAI for GPT.

3. **Create a GPT Interaction Function:**
   Define a function that interacts with GPT using the OpenAI API.

   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'

   def generate_response(prompt):
       response = openai.Completion.create(
           engine="text-davinci-002",
           prompt=prompt,
           max_tokens=150
       )
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()
   

4. #List Documents in a Folder:
   #Use Python's os module to list files in a folder.
   
   #python
   import os

   def list_documents(folder_path):
       return [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(folder_path, f))]
   ```

5. **Read Document Content:**
   Create a function to read the content of a document.

   ```python
   def read_document(document_path):
       with open(document_path, 'r') as file:
           return file.read()
   ```

6. **Web Scraping Function:**
   Define a function for web scraping using libraries like `beautifulsoup4` and `requests`.

   ```python
   import requests
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

   def scrape_web_page(url):
       response = requests.get(url)
       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
       # Extract relevant information from the web page
       # Return or print the desired information
   ```

7. **Combine Functions in Chat Interaction:**
   Integrate these functions based on user input.

   ```python
   user_input = "Read the document named 'example.txt'"
   folder_path = 'your_folder_path'  # Replace with the path to your documents folder

   if "Read the document named" in user_input:
       document_name = user_input.split("'")[1]
       if document_name in list_documents(folder_path):
           document_path = os.path.join(folder_path, document_name)
           document_content = read_document(document_path)
           bot_response = generate_response(document_content)
           print(bot_response)
       else:
           print(f"Document '{document_name}' not found.")

   elif "Scrape the web page" in user_input:
       url = user_input.split("'")[1]
       scrape_web_page(url)
   ```

8. **Handle Various User Inputs:**
   Expand the script to handle different user inputs related to documents and web links. Use conditional statements based on the expected commands.

Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual folder path and API key. This is a basic outline, and you might need to add more complexity based on your specific requirements. Handle exceptions, errors, and edge cases to make your chatbot robust.




Creating a chatbot to interact with a folder full of documents involves a combination of natural language processing and file manipulation. Here's a basic outline of how you might approach this using Python, GPT (like OpenAI's GPT), and file handling libraries:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need a library like `openai` for interacting with GPT and possibly other libraries like `os` for file handling.

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

2. **Create/Open a GPT Model:**
   Obtain an API key for OpenAI GPT-3.5 or any other GPT model you prefer. Initialize the OpenAI API using your API key.

   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'
   ```

3. **Define a Function to Interact with GPT:**
   Create a function that takes user input, sends it to GPT for generating a response, and returns the response.

   ```python
   def generate_response(prompt):
       response = openai.Completion.create(
           engine="text-davinci-002",
           prompt=prompt,
           max_tokens=150
       )
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()
   ```

   Adjust the `engine` parameter and other options based on your preferred GPT model.

4. **List and Access Documents:**
   Use Python's `os` module to list files in a folder. Allow the user to specify which document they want to interact with.

   ```python
   import os

   def list_documents(folder_path):
       return [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(folder_path, f))]

   def read_document(document_path):
       with open(document_path, 'r') as file:
           return file.read()
   ```

5. **Integrate GPT with Document Interaction:**
   Combine the GPT interaction function with document listing/reading based on user input.

   ```python
   folder_path = 'your_folder_path'  # Replace with the path to your documents folder

   documents = list_documents(folder_path)

   # Example interaction
   user_input = "Read the document named 'example.txt'"
   if "Read the document named" in user_input:
       document_name = user_input.split("'")[1]
       if document_name in documents:
           document_path = os.path.join(folder_path, document_name)
           document_content = read_document(document_path)
           bot_response = generate_response(document_content)
           print(bot_response)
       else:
           print(f"Document '{document_name}' not found.")
   ```

   Adjust the interaction logic based on your use case and the kind of user input you expect.

Remember, integrating GPT with document interaction requires careful handling of user input and response. Depending on the complexity, you might want to consider error handling, security measures, and other aspects based on your specific use case.
